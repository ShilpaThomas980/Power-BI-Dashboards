# Human Resources Analytics Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project
This project features a dynamic Power BI dashboard developed to support HR teams with actionable insights into employee performance and workforce planning. The dashboard presents key metrics derived from HR analytics and employee data to facilitate smarter, data-driven decision-making.
This project was self-practiced as part of my learning journey in Power BI, inspired by a tutorial I followed on YouTube.
